# Operating System Experiments

This repository contains the implementation of two operating system experiments from the course at Wuhan University of Technology.

## Experiment 1: Dynamic Partition Management

This experiment focuses on implementing dynamic partition memory management. The goal is to simulate the management of memory partitions, allocating and deallocating memory based on processes' requirements.

### Features:
- Simulate dynamic partition allocation and deallocation.
- Implement strategies like first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit.
- Track memory usage and fragmentation.

## Experiment 2: Disk Scheduling

This experiment simulates disk scheduling algorithms to manage read/write requests to disk drives efficiently.

### Features:
- Implement disk scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
  - SCAN (Elevator algorithm)
- Simulate disk arm movement and evaluate algorithm performance.
